This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

1. Authentication
Create a user authentication system in Next.js using Shadcn and TailwindCSS. Include sign-up, login, and logout pages with form validation for username, email, and password fields. Display error messages appropriately for failed validation. Redirect users to the Task List screen after successful login. Use Shadcn components like modals for the login/register forms, ensuring smooth transitions. Make the design fully responsive, adjusting for mobile, tablet, and desktop screens using TailwindCSS. Prioritize accessibility and a clean UI using Shadcn principles.

2. Task List Screen with CRUD Functionality
Build a Task List screen in Next.js using Shadcn and TailwindCSS. Display tasks in a list view, including filtering and sorting options by status, priority, and due date. Allow users to create, edit, and delete tasks directly from this view using modals for task forms. Each task should have fields like Title, Description, Status (To Do, In Progress, Completed), Priority (Low, Medium, High), and Due Date. Use Shadcn components for dropdowns, modals, and notifications. Ensure full responsiveness across mobile, tablet, and desktop screens with TailwindCSS. Maintain a visually appealing and user-friendly interface.


3. Kanban Board Screen
Build a Kanban board screen in Next.js using Shadcn and TailwindCSS. Display tasks categorized under "To Do," "In Progress," and "Completed" columns, and implement drag-and-drop functionality to move tasks between statuses dynamically. Use Shadcn components like drag-and-drop areas and tooltips for user guidance. Update the status of tasks immediately when moved. Design the Kanban board to be fully responsive, adapting seamlessly between mobile, tablet, and desktop screen sizes using TailwindCSS. Ensure a clean and user-friendly design.

4. Create forms for managing tasks in Next.js using Shadcn and TailwindCSS. Include fields like Title (required), Description (optional), Status (To Do, In Progress, Completed), Priority (Low, Medium, High), and Due Date (optional). Use Shadcn modal components for displaying the forms. Implement form validation and display error messages appropriately. Ensure the forms are responsive across all screen sizes, providing a smooth user experience on mobile, tablet, and desktop with TailwindCSS. Use notifications to inform users when tasks are successfully created, edited, or deleted.
